## Features 

- **Auto-detection and automation**: Understands your content structure and lets you focus on writing.
- **CMS-like homepage**: See your content in a visual grid and perform bulk actions.
- **Preconfigured**: Optimized settings, hotkeys, and plugins for the Astro workflow.
- **Headless and flexible**: Just Markdown files and a workspace ready to be customized by you.
- **Compatability**: Works with almost any Astro theme.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to install Vault CMS into your Astro project is via the CLI at your project root:

```bash
pnpm create vaultcms
```

*Follow the prompts to install into `src/content` or your desired sub-directory.*

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually, you can download the latest version of Vault CMS and place it directly into your Astro project.

1. **Download the source**: [Clone this repository](https://github.com/davidvkimball/vaultcms) or [download the ZIP archive](https://github.com/davidvkimball/vaultcms/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. **Locate your content directory**: In most Astro projects, this is `src/content`.
3. **Move the files**: Copy the `.obsidian` and `_bases` folders (and `_GUIDE.md`) from the Vault CMS source into your content directory.
4. **Open in Obsidian**: Open the content directory as a new vault in Obsidian.

### Presets

If you are using a supported theme like **Starlight**, **Slate**, or **Chiri**, you can use a preconfigured preset:

```bash
pnpm create vaultcms -- --template starlight
```

See all available presets at the [Presets Repo](https://github.com/davidvkimball/vaultcms-presets).
